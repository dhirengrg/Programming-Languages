# 8-1 Journal: Portfolio Submission
•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project was the “Grocery Tracking Program” which is excellent program to practice using link to the different file from the coding file for inventory and it was new great experience to collaborate the program with Python code and C++ at the same time.
•	What did you do particularly well?

I was successful to create the link between Python code and C++ in visual studio and I was successful to open file into the Python and link to the C++ for further programming.

•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could enhance my code to make more accurate user input by putting condition such as using if and while loop as well. with these improvements make more efficient because it will not let the program close without any results. if something wrong input was there then it tells user to do designed steps to get the results. 

•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

My challenging code for this project was to loop the user prompt which is also linked to the Python code. Initially I thought the while loop should be in Python code and I tried it but eventually it was failed. using cin.fail() function condition in while loop was successful to overcome the challenges.

•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The skills of opening files would be transferable to the other projects because it helped to understand the concepts of the database and link to the database into the code would be very important in future course work.

•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I collect many materials related to the project and studied it and the zyBook activities helped me to understand the program and action of the code.
